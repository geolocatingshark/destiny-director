    Custom Async version of `lightbulb.checks.has_guild_permissions`
    Prevents the command from being used by a member missing any of the required
    permissions (this takes into account permissions granted by both roles and permission overwrites).

    Args:
        perm1 (:obj:`hikari.Permissions`): Permission to check for.
        *perms (:obj:`hikari.Permissions`): Additional permissions to check for.

    Note:
        This check will also prevent commands from being used in DMs, as you cannot have permissions
        in a DM channel.

    Warning:
        This check is unavailable if your application is stateless and/or missing the intent
        :obj:`hikari.Intents.GUILDS` and will **always** raise an error on command invocation if
        either of these conditions are not met.
