# This architecture for a periodic signal is used since
# apscheduler 3.x has quirks that make it difficult to
# work with in a single process with async without global state.
# These problems are expected to be solved by the release
# of apscheduler 4.x which will have a better async support
# This architecture uses aiohttps requests to a quart (async flask)
# server to send a signal from the scheduler to the reciever.
# The relevant tracking issue for apscheduler 4.x is:
# https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler/issues/465
